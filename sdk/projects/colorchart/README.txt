Color picker utility

To run:  open a web browser and do FILE / OPEN / colorchart.html

In the lower left corner you select the color value notation
You can use the HTML #AABBCC notation, or various other formats
depending on what language you are programming in.

Picking a color chip will load the clipboard with the character string
so just do a Command-V to paste in the color string into your code.

you can type in a hex color value, and when you do that it will select the closest of the 700 color
chips. The hex grid in the lower part is all the colors very close to the one you just entered.
The color differences in many cases will be imperceptible, but that is because most monitors
and your vision, are not capable of resolving even 8 bit colors cleanly. 

The color ramps in the lower section cover the most useful 700 colors. The HTML named colors are shown above.
There are 9 grayscale colors added

The source code is included; the compiler is available upon request.
