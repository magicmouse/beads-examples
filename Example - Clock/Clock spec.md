## Example / A simple analog clock

This simple program will draw a clock on the screen. This is among the shortest possible graphical programs one can imagine.

### The specification for the clock is as follows:
 * fill the screen background with beige
 * calculate a square area that is 80% of the smaller of the width and height
 * in that subarea draw green circle with a dark green border 4 pts, and draw the border on the inside of the circle area
 * consult the system clock, and extract the hour, minute, sec.
 * draw the hour hand in brown, 8pt at 30% of the diameter
 * draw the minute hand in orange, 6pt at 40% of the diameter
 * draw the sweeping second hand in blue, 4pt at 45% of the dia.
 * run the clock at 100 times normal speed
