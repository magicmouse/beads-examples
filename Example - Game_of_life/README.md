### Example: Conway's game of life


This is an example of a program that implements the famous Game of Life invented by Conway

 [run here](http://beadslang.com/projects/game_of_life/life.html). 
 
 The code shows how you can skip testing for array limits, as it is perfectly valid to reference values outside of an array's bounds, you just get the value of U, which is not "truthy".
